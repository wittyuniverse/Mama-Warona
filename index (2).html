          I see the way you care for others,<br>
          How your love holds without asking for return.<br>
          The way your eyes soften at pain,<br>
          And how joy lights you from the inside.<br>
          You are the warmth that teaches a child what safety means.<br>
          You are the embodiment of real and passionate.<br>
          You are love, and love is mothering too.
